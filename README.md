# VLDB Summer School 2022

## Introduction

This is the labs of VLDB Summer School 2022. The target is to build a learning-based optimizer.

The application of learning method in optimizer is mainly reflected in the following two points:

- Cardinality Estimation
- Cost Model

## Labs

There are 4 labs in this course.

- [Lab 1](./lab1/doc/readme.md), build optimizer with some learning-based estimation methods.
- [Lab 2](./lab2/doc/readme.md), build optimizer with some learning-based cost estimation.
- [Lab 3](./lab3/doc/readme.md), implement the estimations in lab1 and lab2,build optimizer.
- [Lab 4](./lab4/doc/readme.md), build an end to end optimizer.


You need to fill some missing code in order to complete labs.

## Autograding

The details of classroom usage can be found in the [classroom doc](docs/classroom.md).

If you don't use [GitHub classroom](https://classroom.github.com/), just fork this repo, work in your repo, you will not have a score.

### Getting started

First, please study the[classroom doc](docs/classroom.md) and clone the repository with git to get the source code of the project.

``` bash
git clone https://github.com/vldbss-2022/vldbss2022-{{username}}.git
```

Then make sure you have installed [python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) toolchains. 

For the other matters needing attention, we will introduce them in detail in each lab.
